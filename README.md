# pathfinding-algorithms-Unity

Reviewed pathfinding algorithms and showed each algorithms diagnostics during gameplay.
Algorithms reviewed: Breadth First Search, Dijkstra, A*, and Greedy Best First.

Implemented custom priority queue instead of using normal queue. 

Implemented terrain weights as a factor in path.

Maps can be generated from text files or image files.
